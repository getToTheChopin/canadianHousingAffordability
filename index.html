    <h1>Tracking Canadian Housing Market Affordability (1999 to 2023)</h1>

    <p>This post digs into historical trends in the Canadian housing market using data on home prices, household incomes, and mortgage rates to paint a picture of housing affordability across the country.</p>

    <p>The interactive tools below examine 14 major Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, etc.), with data spanning the years of 1999 to 2023.</p>

    &nbsp;

    <h2>Multi-City Trends - 1999 to 2023</h2>

    <p>This is an interactive tool to explore the state of the Canadian real estate market across 6 indicators of housing affordability:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Average home price by city<a href="#footnote1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="anchor1"></a></li>
        <li>Household incomes (pre-tax median income)</li>
        <li>Price-to-income ratio</li>
        <li>Implied monthly mortgage payment for new homebuyers<a href="#footnote2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="anchor2"></a></li>
        <li>Implied mortgage payment as a % of income</li>
        <li>"Qualifying" income (income required to buy the average home)<a href="#footnote3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="anchor3"></a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pick an indicator from the drop-down menu below. Click the city labels in the chart to toggle them on/off. Hover over the lines for more details.</p>

    <h2>Canadian Mortgage Rates Over Time - 1999 to 2023</h2>

    <p>To give further context to the trends seen above, here is data on Canadian average mortgage rates over time, from 1999 to 2023.</p>
    
    <p>Mortgage rates are perhaps the single most important driver of changes in home prices. As mortgage rates fall, home prices typically rise. On the other hand, higher mortgage rates typically result in declining home prices. For example: from 2021 to 2023, mortage rates increased from 3.2% to 5.8%, while average home prices in Canada dropped by roughly 15%.</p>

    <h2>Other Trends and Takeaways</h2>

    <p>I'll use this section to highlight a few pieces of data that I found particularly interesting as I poured through the data.</p>

    <h3>The Most Expensive & Least Expensive Cities in Canada</h3>

    <img src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Home-price-by-city-chart.png" alt="Canadian housing market affordability by city">

    <p>Cities with the most expensive homes (based on the average home price in Jan. 2023 as per the MLS home price index):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vancouver: $1,124,400 (average home price)</li>
        <li>Toronto: $1,069,000</li>
        <li>Victoria: $881,600</li>
        <li>Hamilton: $799,800</li>
        <li>Ottawa: $612,100</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cities with the least expensive homes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quebec City: $304,600</li>
        <li>Moncton: $312,300</li>
        <li>Victoria: $320,100</li>
        <li>Winnipeg: $326,300</li>
        <li>Edmonton: $370,900</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As of January 2023, the average home price in Canada is $714,700.</p>

    &nbsp;

    <h3>How Much Have Canadian Home Prices Fallen By?</h3>

    <img src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Gap-to-all-time-high-price-chart-1.png" alt="Decrease in Canadian home prices by city">
    
    <img src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Gap-to-all-time-high-price-table-1.png">

    <p>Across most cities in Canada, real estate prices peaked in Spring 2022, spurred on by a home buying spree during the pandemic. Since then, home prices have tumbled in most major cities in Canada.</p>

    <p>The most severe home price declines have been in Hamilton and Toronto, with current home prices roughly 20% lower than the all-time high price.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, home prices in Calgary / Regina / Saskatoon remain at or near the all-time high.</p>

    <p>As of January 2023, the average home price in Canada has fallen by 15% (current price of $714,700 versus all-time high price of $841,400).</p>

    &nbsp;

    <h3>The Most Unafforable Cities in Canada</h3>

    <img src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Mortgage-percent-of-income-chart.png">
    
    <img src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Mortgage-percent-of-income-table.png">

    <p>In spite of the recent declines in home prices in many cities across Canada, the housing market still remains unaffordable for most potential new homebuyers.</p>

    <p>As of January 2023, a homebuyer who purchases the average home in Canada with a 20% downpayment at current mortgage rates would have a monthly mortgage payment of $3,611 per month ($43,332 per year). Compared to the median pre-tax household income of $89,709 in Canada, this means that the mortgage payment represents 48.3% of income.</p>

    <p>Using this same measure of housing market affordability across Canada, the cities with the most unafforable housing are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Victoria: 73.1% of pre-tax household income paid towards mortgage</li>
        <li>Toronto: 72.4%</li>
        <li>Vancouver: 69.9%</li>
        <li>Hamilton: 52.9%</li>
        <li>Montreal: 43.2%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The average citizen cannot afford to buy the average home in these cities. Paying 50%+ of your <i>pre-tax</i> household income towards your mortgage simply is not financially viable.</p>

    <p>Those who do manage to buy a home in these markets are often dual-income couples with incomes much higher than the average, and/or those fortunate enough to have parents helping to make a sizable downpayment.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, these cities are the most affordable places to live in Canada:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Moncton: 18.9% of pre-tax household income paid towards mortgage</li>
        <li>Regina: 21.0%</li>
        <li>Winnipeg: 23.2%</li>
        <li>Edmonton: 23.8%</li>
        <li>Quebec City: 23.8%</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Footnotes:</p>
        <p id="footnote1">[1]: In this post, the "average" home price is based on the MLS home price index, which tracks the price of a “benchmark” home in each city over time, assuming constant quality/attributes.  <a href="#anchor1" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
        <p id="footnote2">[2]: The implied monthly mortgage payment is calculated assuming that a homebuyer purchases the average home in their city, taking on a mortgage equal to 80% of the average home price with a 25-year term and a mortgage rate equal to the then current average 5-year fixed mortgage rate at the time of purchase.  <a href="#anchor2" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
        <p id="footnote3">[3]: "Qualifying income" is the estimated income required to buy the average home in each city, assuming that a homeowner's mortgage payment is equal to 32% of their pre-tax household income. The 32% affordability threshold is a rule of thumb used in the Canadian mortgage lending industry. For example, you would need an annual pre-tax household income of $112,500 to qualify for a mortgage payment which costs $3,000 per month.  <a href="#anchor3" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
